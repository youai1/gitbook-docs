# Publish an App

## Overview

Publishing an AI app makes it public to members of your [Workspace](../workspaces/what-is-a-workspace.md). You can configure the [Share Settings](set-share-settings.md) to publish your app to users outside of your Workspace. Note that after an app is published, you can delete it but you cannot unpublish it.

## Publish an App

1. Choose the app to publish, and open the MindStudio Editor.
2. Select the **Publish** button in the top right.

A pop-up displays to notify you that the changes are now live.

Open the published app or continue making changes.
