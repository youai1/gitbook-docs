# Benchmark the Profiles in the Profiler

## Overview

Benchmark selected AI models side-by-side using the identical [Prompt](../prompt-writing/what-is-a-prompt.md). Each AI model runs in its own profile during the test to display real-time responses.

Note that [usage costs apply](../workspaces/manage-workspace-usage/#ai-app-events-that-cost-credits) for the AI models run in the Profiler.

See this [best practice](select-the-ai-model-in-a-profile.md#best-practice) when selecting the AI model in each profile prior to benchmarking.

## Benchmark the Profiles

1. [View the Profiler](view-the-profiler.md).
2. [Add a profile](add-a-profile-to-the-profiler.md) for each AI model to benchmark.
3. [Select the AI model](select-the-ai-model-in-a-profile.md) in each profile as necessary.
4. In the prompt shown as using the `$` symbol within any of the profiles, enter the Prompt for benchmarking. The same Prompt displays in the other profile panes as you enter your Prompt.
5. Select the **Enter** key on your keyboard.

The benchmark test runs in real-time. Faster-responding AI models display their responses before slower-responding models. Benchmarking data display for each profile after the test completes.
