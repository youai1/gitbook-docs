# Add a Profile to the Profiler

## Overview

By default, the [Profiler](what-is-the-profiler.md) displays two profiles to benchmark. Each is the [underlying AI model](../model-settings/view-underlying-ai-model-settings.md) for that AI. Add a new profile to the Profiler to benchmark it with other selected AI models in the Profiler using the identical [Prompt](../prompt-writing/what-is-a-prompt.md).

## Add a New Profile to the Profiler

1. [View the Profiler](view-the-profiler.md).
2. Select the **New Profile** button at the bottom-left of the leftmost pane.

A new pane displays to the right of the current profiles in the Profiler using the underlying AI model to profile by default. [Select another AI model for that profile](select-the-ai-model-in-a-profile.md) if necessary.

## Remove a Profile

1. View the Profiler.
2. Select the **Close** icon (**x**) for the profile to remove it from the Profiler.

By removing a profile from the Profiler, the AI model configured for that profile no longer is available in benchmark testing.
