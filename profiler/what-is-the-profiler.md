# What is the Profiler?

The Profiler benchmarks selected AI models side-by-side using the identical [Prompt](../prompt-writing/what-is-a-prompt.md). Each AI model displays in a separate pane from the others to view their responses.

Test the response time for selected AI models, while watching those models render real-time responses.

Note that [usage costs apply](../workspaces/manage-workspace-usage/#ai-app-events-that-cost-credits) for the AI models run in the Profiler.
