## Delete Multiple Automation Blocks

   * Click to drag and highlight the desired Blocks.
   * Hold the **Shift** key on your keyboard while selecting the desired Blocks.
2. Select the **Delete Selected Blocks** icon in the bottom Automation Canvas toolbar.

Note that the [Start Block](types-of-automation-blocks/#start-block) cannot be deleted even if it is selected. All [Automation Workflows](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1toaFJsLE1X6JYnnOJFZcfibk1dmmChz\_-t636cJdr\_8/edit?usp=sharing) require the Start Block.
