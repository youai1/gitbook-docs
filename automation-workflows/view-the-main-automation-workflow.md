# View the Main Automation Workflow

## Overview

The Entry [Automation Workflow](what-is-an-automation-workflow.md) starts your app when it runs. Your AI may use multiple Automation Workflows, but the Entry Automation Workflow, named “Main.flow,” is the default. If Main.flow has been renamed or [another Automation Workflow is configured to be the Entry](../ai-app-settings/set-global-settings.md#entry-workflow), the label **(entry)** displays after the main Automation Workflow.

The [Entry Automation Workflow](../ai-app-settings/set-global-settings.md#entry-workflow) can be changed in your AI’s [Global Settings](../ai-app-settings/set-global-settings.md).
