# Connect Automation Blocks

## Overview

Connect Blocks in the [Automation Workflow](what-is-an-automation-workflow.md) from left to right in the Automation Canvas. Blocks must connect together for the AI to route tasks between them.

When [adding a Block ](add-a-block-to-an-automation-workflow.md)between currently connected Blocks, the new Block automatically connects between them.

1. Select the Automation Block to begin the connection. A node on each side of that Block displays.
2. Select a node, and then drag to the desired Automation Block to set the connection.

An arrow shows the direction the Automation Workflow routes between the connected Blocks.

## Reroute Connected Automation Blocks

2. Select and drag the node  to the desired Automation Block in which to reroute the connection.

An arrow shows the direction of the rerouted connection.
