# Use Multiple AI Models in an Automation Workflow

Your AI can use more than one AI model. For example:

* [Select the underlying AI model](../model-settings/select-the-underlying-ai-model.md) in each Workflow to respond to that Workflowâ€™s [Prompt](../prompt-writing/what-is-a-prompt.md).
* Set each [Send Message Block](types-of-automation-blocks/#send-message-block) in any [Automation Workflow](what-is-an-automation-workflow.md) to message any supported AI model.
