# Add a Block to an Automation Workflow

## Overview

An Automation Block, also referred to as a Block, is a task within an [Automation Workflow](what-is-an-automation-workflow.md). Each Block is an automated action in an AI. By default, the Automation Canvas always displays the [Start Block](types-of-automation-blocks/#start-block) and the [Terminator Block](types-of-automation-blocks/#terminator-block).&#x20;

## Add a Block Between Existing Blocks

1. Select the **+** icon between two Blocks in the Automation Workflow.
2. Select the Block to add in that location:
   * [Generate Text Block](https://docs.mindstudio.ai/youai/automation-workflows/types-of-automation-blocks/generate-text-block-settings)
   * [Generate Image Block](https://docs.mindstudio.ai/youai/automation-workflows/types-of-automation-blocks/generate-image-block-settings)
   * [Text to Speech](https://docs.mindstudio.ai/youai/automation-workflows/types-of-automation-blocks/text-to-speech-block-settings)
   * [Analyze Image](https://docs.mindstudio.ai/youai/automation-workflows/types-of-automation-blocks/analyze-image-block-settings)
   * [Display Text Block](https://docs.mindstudio.ai/youai/automation-workflows/types-of-automation-blocks/display-text-block-settings)
   * [User Input Block](types-of-automation-blocks/#user-input-block)
   * [Query Data Block](types-of-automation-blocks/#query-data-source-block)
   * [Run Function Block](types-of-automation-blocks/#run-function-block)
   * [Terminator Block](types-of-automation-blocks/#terminator-block)
   * [Menu Block](types-of-automation-blocks/#menu-block)
   * [Logic Block](types-of-automation-blocks/#logic-block)
   * [Jump Block](types-of-automation-blocks/#jump-block)

When adding a Block between currently connected Blocks, the new Block automatically connects between them.

2. Select the Block to add in that location.
3. [Connect the new Block](connect-automation-blocks.md) into your Automation Workflow.
