# Embed an AI App

## Overview

Enabling the embed feature allows MindStudio AI Developers to embed their applications into third-party websites.

Note that [advanced embedding](advanced-embedding.md) is only available if your MindStudio [Workspace](../workspaces/what-is-a-workspace.md) is on the Pro plan or higher. See MindStudio's [Pricing](https://youai.ai/pricing) page.

## Best Practice

[Name your MindStudio AI](../publishing/app-details.md) to indicate if it is using simple embedding or [advanced embedding](advanced-embedding.md). This helps after you embed your AI into target websites which type of embedding it is using.

## Enable Embed&#x20;

1. Navigate to the [App Settings](broken-reference).
2. Under the **Access** section, select **Embedding**.
3. Select the **Enable** button.

## Embed an Application

### Authorize the Domain&#x20;

1. Ensure **Embedding** is enabled.
2. Enter in the domain name of the website to embed into the **Authorized Domains** setting.
3. Select the **Save** button.&#x20;

To authorize more than one domain:

1. Select the **+** icon.
2. Enter another domain into the **Domain** setting.
3. Continue preceding steps for additional domains.
4. Select the **Save** button after you have added all domains.

### Embed the Code

After the domains have been authorized, copy the **Embed Code** and paste it into an embed block on your third-party website builder. This process differs depending on the website builder you use.

Note that the embedding experience WILL NOT work on Google Website builders.
