# Guest Access Embed on Webflow

## Overview

Allow anyone to access your AI agent by enabling guest access. This is an easy method to embed  your AI agent.

## Enable Guest Access

Enable guest access to your AI agent.

1. Select the name of your AI agent.
2. Select **Embedding** under **Sharing**.
3. Select **Enable Guest Access**.
4. Copy the code to embed into your website.

## Add to Webflow

Add the embed code to your Webflow website.

1. Open your **Webflow Dashboard**, then do one of the following:
   1. Select **New site** to create a new site, then select **Blank site**.
   2. Open your blank website in **Design** mode.
2. Select your blank page.
3. Click the **+** button from the left-side toolbar to add an element.
4. Search for "embed", then select the **Code Embed** element.
5. Paste the code you copied from MindStudio into the Code block.&#x20;
6. Resize the MindStudio embed code as necessary in one of the following ways:
   1. Resize the MindStudio embed code to ensure your AI agent fits comfortably (e.g., set width to 100% of the container and height to 600px+).
   2. Double‑click your **Code Embed** element on the canvas to reopen the custom code editor. In the iframe tag, change the height value, for example: `height="600"` for a fixed pixel height, or `height="100%"` to let it fill its parent container. Set width to, for example: `width="800"` for a fixed pixel height, or `width="100%"`.
   3. Select the **Code Embed** element itself (not the iframe code) on the canvas. In the right‑side **Style** panel, set a width and height under **Size** so the Embed box fits your AI agent well.
7. Click **Publish**. Your AI agent is live.
