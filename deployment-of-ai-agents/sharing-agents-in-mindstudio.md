## What Is Agent Sharing in MindStudio?

Agent sharing lets you publish, promote, and monetize your workflows across platforms like LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram.

By enabling remixing and linking your affiliate account, others can copy your agents—and you receive referral credit when they sign up for a subscription.

Agent sharing is ideal for:

* Growing your audience by showcasing useful workflows
* Teaching others how to build and customize agents
* Earning affiliate commissions from referrals

***

## Enable Remixing and Publish Your Agent

1. Open your agent.
2. Go to the **Access tab** → Enable **Remixing**.
3. Open the **Landing Page tab** → Fill out:
   * **Name** and **Subtitle**
   * **Functional Description** (short pitch)
   * **Full Description** (longer markdown tutorial, optional)
   * **Tags** for SEO
   * **Tutorials, Images, or Sample Assets**
   * **Preview Workflow** (pick the most visually compelling one)
4. Upload a custom **Social Sharing Image** (recommended: screenshot of your workflow).
5. Click **Publish**.

## Share Your Remix Link

After publishing:

1. Return to **Access tab**.
2. Click **Copy Remix Link**.
3. Share this link on LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, or anywhere your audience is.

When someone clicks **Make a Copy**, your PartnerStack link tracks their signup and credits you for the referral.

## Set Up Your Affiliate Link

1. Open **Account Settings** (gear icon).
2. Scroll to **PartnerStack Affiliate URL**.
3. Click **Sign Up** and register.
4. Copy your unique referral link into the field and save.

Without this step, you won’t receive referral credit.

## Best Practices for Sharing Agents

#### Show Off Complex Workflows

Posts with detailed, visually interesting workflows perform best.

* Add block icons and annotations for clarity.
* Use screenshots as thumbnails or social sharing images.

#### Use Tutorials and Demos

Create walkthroughs that explain:

* How to configure schedules
* How to customize topics
* How to adapt agents for different use cases

#### Drive Engagement

On LinkedIn and other platforms:

* Use “comment to get the link” strategies to boost engagement.
* Share consistently (daily if possible).
* Experiment with both short-form (TikTok/Reels) and long-form (YouTube) content.
