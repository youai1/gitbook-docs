# AI-Powered Web Apps

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/kt-I1017Q8U" %}

## Overview

AI-powered web apps are one of the most accessible and flexible ways to deploy AI Agents built in MindStudio. Once published, your AI Agent is automatically available as a standalone web app with a unique link that you can share or bookmark.

These web apps are ideal for:

* Sharing with users or teammates
* Bookmarking for personal productivity
* Rapid testing and feedback cycles

## How It Works

Every AI Agent you publish is hosted on a secure, publicly accessible URL. Users can interact with it just like they would with any other web-based application.&#x20;

If your Agent includes input fields (via User Inputs), these will appear as a form on the web app. Once submitted, the AI Agent runs its workflow and returns results directly within the browser.

## Key Features

* **Public or Private Access**: Control visibility via workspace sharing settings.
* **Instant Deployment**: No server or hosting configuration required — MindStudio handles everything.

## Example Use Cases

* A content simplifier tool for internal teams
* A resume review assistant embedded on a career page
* A personalized email generator for sales outreach
* An AI concierge embedded on a support site

## Setup Requirements

No special setup is required.

In the Start Block, **Run Mode** should be set to **On-Demand (Default).**

Once you publish an AI Agent, it is immediately accessible via its unique MindStudio-hosted URL. Agents run directly in the browser when the link is opened — no hosting, configuration, or API keys are needed.

## Enabling Sharing

To share this kind of AI Agent with someone else, you must **enable Public Use** in the Access section of your AI Agent settings.

Once published, you can share this agent by clicking on the three dots at the top right of your agent, and  then clicking **Invite Users,** where you can invite people to use your app via email or by copying and sharing the unique link to your agen&#x74;**.**
