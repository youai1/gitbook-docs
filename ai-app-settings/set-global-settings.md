# Set Global Settings

## Entry Workflow

Set the [Entry Workflow](../automation-workflows/manage-workflows.md#set-a-workflow-as-the-entry-workflow) by selecting a Workflow from the drop-down menu. **Main.flow** will be selected by default.

## Onboarding

Onboarding allows AI Developers to set [User Inputs](../user-inputs-and-variables/what-is-a-user-input.md) that users only see the first time they enter an AIâ€™s Workflow.

1. Select the **+** icon at the bottom of the **Onboarding** setting.
2.  From the **Choose User Input Prompts to add:** pop-up, select the User Inputs in the order to display them to the app user during onboarding. Add multiple consecutive User Inputs by pressing the **Shift** key on your keyboard.

    If necessary:

    * Select the arrow beside a User Input to open it from the **User Input** folder in the **Explorer** tab.
    * Select the **Create New** button to create a new User Input. The new User Input is automatically added and saved to the **User Input** folder.
3. Select the **Add** button.

## Global Logging

Global Logging enables all user transcripts to be logged and made available as part of the app's analytics. Users are notified that their session is being logged.

Set Global Logging by selecting **Enabled** or **Disabled** from the drop-down menu. **Disabled** is selected by default.
