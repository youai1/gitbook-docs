# View the Debugger

## Overview

The Debugger displays detailed interactions with your app. The Debugger breaks up the interactions into 4 main sections:

* **Message:** The Message section shows the sent and received messages between you and the AI.
* **Variables:** The Variables section shows all the [Variables](../user-inputs-and-variables/what-is-a-variable.md) used and the value for each Variable.
* **Preamble:** The Preamble section shows how the AI has interpreted your [Prompt](../prompt-writing/what-is-a-prompt.md).
* **Prompt:** The Prompt section allows you to make edits to, or re-write, your Prompt.
