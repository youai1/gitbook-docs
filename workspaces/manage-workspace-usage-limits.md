# Manage Workspace Usage Limits

## Overview

The **Limits** tab displays spend usage limits to the [Workspace](what-is-a-workspace.md) after the credits set on the **Billing** tab are depleted. The usage limit is the maximum usage MindStudio allows for your Workspace each month.

## View the Limits Tab

1. [View Workspace settings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1catu2bMOAyW18KDGn45Zn5v0q4KHhONK75\_PyWGNO6A/edit?usp=sharing).
2. Select the **Limits** tab.

## Set the Workspace Monthly Budget

Set the spend amount the Workspace allows monthly. Subsequent spend suspends app usage until the next monthly pay period begins.

1. [View the **Limits** tab](manage-workspace-usage-limits.md#view-the-limits-tab).
2. From the **Monthly workspace budget** setting, enter the monthly spend budget allowed for this Workspace. If the setting is empty, the budget is unlimited.

## Set the Monthly User Budget

Set the spend amount each user in the Workspace is allowed monthly. Subsequent spend suspends that userâ€™s app usage until the next monthly pay period begins.

1. [View the **Limits** tab](manage-workspace-usage-limits.md#view-the-limits-tab).
2. From the **User budget** setting, enter the monthly spend budget allowed for each user. If the setting is empty, the budget is unlimited.

## Set Email Notification Threshold Amount

Set the amount of spend remaining in the Workspace that month to be sent an email notification. Notification emails are sent to the [Owner](manage-workspace-members-and-roles.md#owner-role) of the Workspace.

1. [View the **Limits** tab](manage-workspace-usage-limits.md#view-the-limits-tab).
2. From the **Email notification threshold** setting, enter the amount of spend remaining to be sent an email notification.
