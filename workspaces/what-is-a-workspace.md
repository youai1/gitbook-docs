# What Is a Workspace?

A Workspace is the central hub in MindStudio that contains all your AI builds and any invited members. When you create a MindStudio account, you have your own Workspace.

</div>

Alternatively, if a MindStudio Developer invites you to MindStudio, you become a member in that Workspace. You do not have your own Workspace unless you have created your own MindStudio account. As you spend MindStudio credits to run your AI apps in another member’s Workspace, that Workspace owner must buy more credits.

So, you can be a member of a Workspace and have your own Workspace. You can view all Workspaces in which you are a member, regardless of whether they are your own or someone else’s.
