# What is a Custom Function?

A Custom Function is a pre-built Block that automates interactions with third-party applications and services in AI [Automation Workflows](../automation-workflows/what-is-an-automation-workflow.md). For example:

* Perform basic and custom Google searches
* Generate images from AI models
* Get YouTube video data
* Collect emails from your MailChimp account
* Send data to a Slack or Zapier webhook
* Many other interactions

Each Custom Function is written in JavaScript with a user interface so AI Developers can configure the Custom Function in their AIs Automation Workflows. Each Custom Function must be configured individually.
