# What is a User Input?

## Overview

A User Input collects data from your app users. When data is collected by a User Input, that data is stored in a [Variable](what-is-a-variable.md) that can be referenced elsewhere in an [Automation Workflow](../automation-workflows/what-is-an-automation-workflow.md).

## Types of User Input Data

User Inputs can collect the following types of data from the app user:

* **Text:** Users can input both short form and long form text.
* **Choices:** Users can select from text choices or image choices.
* **Images:** Users can upload an image.
* **Files:** Users can upload text-based files (.XLSX, .CSV, .DOCX, .TXT, .PDF, .HTML).
* **URLs:** Users can input a URL to scrape its text.&#x20;
