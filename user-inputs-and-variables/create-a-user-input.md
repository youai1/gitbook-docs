# Create a User Input

## Overview

Whenever a [User Input](what-is-a-user-input.md) is created, that input is stored in the User Inputs folder in the Explorer on the left.

## Create a User Input

Within the MindStudio Editor, there are two ways to create User Inputs:

* [Create from the User Inputs Folder](create-a-user-input.md#create-from-the-user-inputs-folder)
* [Create from a User Input Block](create-a-user-input.md#create-from-a-user-input-block)

### Create from the User Inputs Folder

1. Navigate to the **User Inputs** folder in the left-side panel and select the (**+**) icon. This opens the **User Input configuration** screen.
2. Configure the User Input information to fit your needs:
   * [Long Text User Input Settings](types-of-user-inputs/long-text-user-input-settings.md)
   * [Short Text User Input Settings](types-of-user-inputs/short-text-user-input-settings.md)
   * [Text Choice User Input Settings](types-of-user-inputs/text-choice-user-input-settings.md)
   * [Image Choice User Input Settings](types-of-user-inputs/image-choice-user-input-settings.md)
   * [Rating User Input Settings](types-of-user-inputs/rating-user-input-settings.md)
   * [Date User Input Settings](types-of-user-inputs/date-user-input-settings.md)
   * [Display User Input Settings](types-of-user-inputs/display-user-input-settings.md)
   * [Scrape URL User Input Settings](types-of-user-inputs/scrape-url-user-input-settings.md)
   * [Upload File User Input Settings](types-of-user-inputs/upload-file-user-input-settings.md)
   * [Upload Image User Input Settings](broken-reference)
3. Your input automatically saves in the User Input folder after you open the configuration screen. Locate it by its Variable name.

### Create from a User Input Block

1. From the Automation Canvas, [add a User Input Block](../automation-workflows/add-a-block-to-an-automation-workflow.md).
2. In the configuration panel on the right, select the (**+**) icon.
3. From the **Choose User Input Prompts to add:** pop-up, select the **Create New** button.
4. Configure the User Input information to fit your needs:
   * [Long Text User Input Settings](types-of-user-inputs/long-text-user-input-settings.md)
   * [Short Text User Input Settings](types-of-user-inputs/short-text-user-input-settings.md)
   * [Text Choice User Input Settings](types-of-user-inputs/text-choice-user-input-settings.md)
   * [Image Choice User Input Settings](types-of-user-inputs/image-choice-user-input-settings.md)
   * [Rating User Input Settings](types-of-user-inputs/rating-user-input-settings.md)
   * [Date User Input Settings](types-of-user-inputs/date-user-input-settings.md)
   * [Display User Input Settings](types-of-user-inputs/display-user-input-settings.md)
   * [Scrape URL User Input Settings](types-of-user-inputs/scrape-url-user-input-settings.md)
   * [Upload File User Input Settings](types-of-user-inputs/upload-file-user-input-settings.md)
   * [Upload Image User Input Settings](broken-reference)
5. Your User Input automatically saves in the **User Input** folder and the User Input Block after you open the configuration screen. Locate it by its Variable name.
