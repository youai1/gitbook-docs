# MindStudio Documentation

## What is MindStudio?

[**MindStudio**](https://youai.ai/mindstudio) is a platform that lets businesses rapidly create, deploy, and distribute bespoke AI-powered applications.

Using MindStudio, businesses can build AIs without code to create powerful web applications with onboarding screens, menus, forms, multiâ€‘step workflows, databases, and more.

MindStudio is AI agnostic, leverage a list of existing AI models to perform tasks in your app based on which model is best suited for your use case.

This application layer acts as the bridge between raw AI capabilities and real world utility. While foundational models provide the base intelligence, the application layer molds it into a shape we can use and gives it specific capabilities that stretch far beyond any individual model.

Building AI powered apps using MindStudio is simple and doesn't require any technical knowledge to get started.&#x20;
