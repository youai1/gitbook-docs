# What is a Data Source?

A Data Source is an uploaded file or group of files to integrate custom data to your AI. A Data Source allows the AI model to leverage additional information beyond its default training data. This provides a simple way to customize the AI's knowledge for your specific needs.

When you upload the file(s) to a new Data Source, it is converted to a vector database the AI model can query before generating a response to users.

Data Sources can be accessed from the **Data Sources** folder in the **Explorer** tab of the left-side panel.
