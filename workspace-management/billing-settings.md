## Account Balance

The [**Account Balance**](https://app.mindstudio.ai/workspace/settings/billing?page=overview) page offers an overview of your current billing plan, balance, and auto-recharge settings. Here are the primary controls available:

### Current Plan

Your current subscription plan is displayed here. If you're interested in upgrading, click [**Explore Business Plans**](https://www.mindstudio.ai/pricing) to view available options.

### Current Balance

Your workspace's current account balance is shown prominently. You can add funds manually by clicking **Add Funds**.

### Auto Recharge

Auto-recharge simplifies balance management by ensuring your workspace always has sufficient funds.

* **Trigger Threshold**: Specify the balance level at which the auto-recharge activates (e.g., $25.00).
* **Recharge Amount**: Set the amount to bring the balance back up to (e.g., $100.00).
* **Payment Method**: Select a saved payment method for automatic transactions.Enable or disable auto-recharge with the corresponding controls: **Enable/Disable Auto Recharge**.

Make sure to click **Save** after making any changes to your auto-recharge settings.

## Budgets and Limits

The [**Budgets and Limits**](https://app.mindstudio.ai/workspace/settings/billing?page=limits) page allows you to manage your workspace's spending by setting monthly limits for the entire workspace and individual users. This ensures that you maintain control over costs and receive notifications if limits are exceeded.

### Monthly Workspace Budget

Set a maximum budget for the entire workspace for a given calendar month. Once the workspace exceeds this limit, subsequent usage will be suspended until the next billing period. Enter the desired budget amount in the provided field and click **Save** to apply the changes.

### Monthly User Budget

Define spending limits for individual users within the workspace. If a user exceeds their personal usage budget for any app during the calendar month, their usage will be suspended until the next month. Adjust this value for tighter control of individual expenditures and click **Save** to confirm the updates.

## Payment Methods

The [**Payment Methods**](https://app.mindstudio.ai/workspace/settings/billing?page=payment-methods) page is where you can manage the billing details and payment options for your workspace. Having a saved payment method ensures a seamless process for recharging your account balance and avoiding interruptions in service.

### Billing Address

The billing address associated with your payment methods is displayed at the top of this page. Ensure this information is accurate for compliance and invoicing purposes.

### Managing Payment Methods

A list of saved payment methods is shown under the **Payment Method** section. Each method displays key details, including:

* **Card Information**: Shows the last four digits of the saved card and its expiration date.
* **Default Method**: The card designated as the default for auto-recharge is marked here.
* **Actions**: Use the trash icon to delete a payment method, if needed.

## Receipts

The [**Receipts**](https://app.mindstudio.ai/workspace/settings/billing?page=receipts) page provides a detailed record of all billing transactions for your workspace. This section is designed to help you track payments, usage charges, and other billing activities, ensuring transparency and ease of record-keeping.

### Transaction Details

Each transaction is listed with the following columns:

* **Date**: The date when the transaction occurred.
* **Summary**: A brief description of the transaction (e.g., "New Member Added").
* **Amount**: The monetary value associated with the transaction. Positive values indicate credits, while negative values represent charges.

### Downloading Receipts

For each transaction, a **Download** link is available in the rightmost column. Clicking this link allows you to download a detailed receipt for the selected transaction. This feature is particularly useful for maintaining records or for financial reporting purposes.

With this streamlined layout, the Receipts page ensures all financial details are readily accessible, making workspace management simple and efficient.
