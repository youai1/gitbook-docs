# Select the Underlying AI Model

## Overview

The [underlying AI model](view-underlying-ai-model-settings.md) primarily interacts with an [Automation Workflow](../automation-workflows/what-is-an-automation-workflow.md).

View these settings for a Workflow's underlying AI model:

* the name of the underlying AI model
* [the **Temperature** setting for that AI model](adjust-ai-model-temperature-settings.md)
* [the **Max Response Size** setting for that AI model](adjust-ai-model-max-response-size.md)

[See the AI models that MindStudio supports](types-of-ai-models.md).

## Select the Underlying AI Model for an Automation Workflow

1. [View the underlying AI model](view-underlying-ai-model-settings.md).
2. From the **Underlying Model** setting, select the AI model that primarily interacts with that Automation Workflow.

Note that each AI model costs differently. Your [Workspace](../workspaces/what-is-a-workspace.md) accrues the [usage cost](../workspaces/manage-workspace-usage/#ai-app-events-that-cost-credits) for the AI model(s) your MindStudio AIs use.
