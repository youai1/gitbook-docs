# Select an Image Model

## Overview

Selecting an image model from the model settings will allow users to generate images directly inside of the chat interface of your application.

To select an image model, you must select an underlying model that has a corresponding image model to automatically use this feature. The image model selector will populate on its own.&#x20;

MindStudio currently hosts the following image models:

* [DALL-E 2](https://mindstudio.ai/platform/models/dall-e-2)[ by Open AI](https://openai.com/index/dall-e-2/)
* [DALL-E 3](https://mindstudio.ai/platform/models/dall-e-3)[ by Open AI](https://openai.com/index/dall-e-3/)
