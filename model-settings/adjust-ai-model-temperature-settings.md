# Adjust AI Model Temperature Settings

## Overview

Temperature refers to the amount of randomness in an AI model’s response. A temperature closer to 0 will mostly likely return the same responses each time, while a temperature closer to 1 will make responses more creative and unique.

## Configure Temperature Settings

1. [Navigate to the app's **Model Settings**](view-underlying-ai-model-settings.md).
2. From the **Temperature** setting, drag the scale to the desired temperature size. Alternatively, enter directly into the text field.
