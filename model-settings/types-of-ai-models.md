# Types of AI Models

## Overview

MindStudio is a model agnostic platform. This means that you can utilize a variety of AI models that fit your particular use case. Below lists MindStudio's currently supported AI models.

## [Open AI](https://openai.com/)

### GPT-3.5

GPT-3.5 is known for its advanced language generation and understanding capabilities.

It excels in creating coherent, contextually relevant text, and is adept at a wide range of language tasks including conversation, content creation, and problem-solving.

### GPT-3.5 Instruct

This variant of GPT-3.5 is specifically tuned to follow instructions more effectively and is designed to better understand and adhere to user [Prompts](../prompt-writing/what-is-a-prompt.md), making it more suitable for applications where precise and instruction-following responses were necessary.

Although this model has demonstrated improved performance in understanding and executing specific tasks, it still encounters limitations in understanding highly complex or nuanced instructions.

### GPT 4

GPT-4 is an advanced language model known for its increased capacity compared to its predecessors, offering more nuanced and accurate text generation. It boasts improved understanding and generation abilities, making it more effective in understanding context, generating human-like text, and providing more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

### GPT 4 Turbo

GPT-4-Turbo is a variant of the GPT-4 model, designed to offer faster response times while maintaining the sophisticated language understanding and generation capabilities of GPT-4.

This model is particularly suited for applications that require both high-quality language processing and quick response times, making it ideal for interactive applications like chatbots or real-time content generation.

GPT 4 Turbo responds well to [Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompt writing](../prompt-writing/chain-of-thought-prompt-writing-technique.md).

### GPT 4o

GPT-4o (“o” for “omni”) is a step towards much more natural human-computer interaction—it accepts as input any combination of text, audio, and image and generates any combination of text, audio, and image outputs. It can respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, with an average of 320 milliseconds, which is similar to [human response time](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0903616106)[(opens in a new window)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0903616106) in a conversation. It matches GPT-4 Turbo performance on text in English and code, with significant improvement on text in non-English languages, while also being much faster and 50% cheaper in the API. GPT-4o is especially better at vision and audio understanding compared to existing models.
