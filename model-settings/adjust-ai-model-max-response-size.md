# Adjust AI Model Max Response Size

## Overview

The Max Response Size refers to the size of the AI model's response in tokens. This controls the upper bound of the response size. The model will often stop replying before it reaches the set limit.

## Setting the Max Response Size

1. Navigate to the [Model Settings](view-underlying-ai-model-settings.md).
2. From the **Max Response Size** setting, drag the scale to the desired limit. Alternatively, enter directly into the text field.
