# View Underlying AI Model Settings

## Overview

An underlying AI model is the primary AI model that interacts with each [Automation Workflow](../automation-workflows/what-is-an-automation-workflow.md) in your app. When your AI uses [multiple Automation Workflows](../automation-workflows/use-multiple-ai-models-in-an-automation-workflow.md), each can use a different underlying AI model.

View these settings for a Workflow's underlying AI model:

* [the name of the underlying AI model](select-the-underlying-ai-model.md)
* [the **Temperature** setting for that AI model](adjust-ai-model-temperature-settings.md)
* [the **Max Response Size** setting for that AI model](adjust-ai-model-max-response-size.md)

## View the Model Settings for an Automation Workflow

1. [Edit an AI](../manage-ais/edit-an-ai.md).
2. Locate and expand the **Workflows** folder in the **Explorer** tab.
3. Select any Workflow.
4. Select the **Model Settings** tab.
