# Text to Speech Block

The **Text to Speech Block** converts written text into voice-over audio, allowing you to dynamically generate audio content based on workflow inputs.

## Configurations

### **Text**

Define the text you want to convert to audio. Use `{{variables}}` to dynamically insert text you’d like converted into audio.

### **Output Variable**

Creates a new variable and saves the audio file URL to it. Enter a `variable_name` \*\*\*\*to store the response for later use in the workflow.

### **Model Settings**

Choose the AI Model you’d like to use to generate the audio. Different models will have unique settings to adjust the output’s characteristics. Review the selected model’s specific options for a full list of configurations.
