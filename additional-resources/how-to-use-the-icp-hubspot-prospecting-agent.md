### Tips for Getting Good Leads

***

Getting the most out of your Prospecting Agent starts with giving it the right level of focus. The AI uses your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) to find and qualify leads â€” but itâ€™s important to know that **this agent is not additive**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Adding more criteria doesnâ€™t expand your search. It actually narrows it.** The more specific your criteria, the smaller your result set may be â€” and in some cases, **you may not find any leads at all** if your search is too restrictive.
{% endhint %}

#### **Adjust Scope Based on Your Goal**

If you want **more results**, keep your ICP broader (e.g., _B2B SaaS companies_).

If you want **fewer but highly targeted leads**, narrow your ICP (e.g., _B2B SaaS startups using HubSpot in North America_).

Experiment with both approaches to find the sweet spot for your pipeline goals.

#### **Start Simple, Then Refine**

Begin with only a few key ICP attributes such as **industry**, **region**, or **company size**. Once you see the first batch of results, refine your search with additional qualifiers to improve relevance.

#### **Use Clear and Common Role Titles**

When specifying target contacts, stick with standard job titles like _Head of Sales_, _Marketing Director_, or _Operations Manager_. Avoid unconventional or vague terms that the AI may not recognize consistently.

#### **Avoid Overloading the Keywords**

The agent works best with concise, structured input. Skip long sentences or multiple clauses â€” focus on short, descriptive phrases (e.g., Software\*, Saas, Retail, B2b\*).

#### **Iterate to Optimize**

Each run gives you a snapshot of whatâ€™s possible. Review your results and try again.

#### **Expect Variability**

Depending on your niche and specificity, some searches will return many results, while others might return few or none. This variability is normal â€” experiment with different input combinations to find what works best.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Pro Tip:** If you discover a search that returns high or low quality results, take a note for future use. You can rerun it later to refresh your pipeline without starting from scratch.
