### MindStudio FAQs

<details>

<summary>What is MindStudio?</summary>

[MindStudio](https://youai.ai) is the fastest way to build AI-powered apps. These apps go beyond simple chatbots. Using the no-code editor, anyone can build full web apps with onboarding screens, menus, forms, multi-step workflows, AI intelligence, custom vector databases, and more.

All apps built with MindStudio leverage AI models as the base intelligence, and you can use multiple models within the same app, letting you choose the right AI model for the right task.

Once published, your new AI app can live anywhere on the web. You can embed it into your website, use it in your own custom applications, or just share it as a link.

<details>

<summary>Can I use my own data in my AI-powered apps?</summary>

Yes. Your AIs built with MindStudio can use modern retrieval augmented generation (RAG) techniques to reference information from your own custom [Data Sources](broken-reference), which are securely stored and never used for LLM training.

</details>

<details>

<summary>If a feature is not available for my app, can I add custom functionality?</summary>

While no code is required to build AIs, MindStudio is extensible by JavaScript developers, who can extend the capabilities of your AI apps with [Custom Functions](broken-reference), unlocking limitless potential for your business or use case.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I integrate other third-party tools or libraries with MindStudio apps?</summary>

MindStudio is built with connectivity in mind, letting you easily integrate other apps and services to your AI Workflows. This makes it easy to incorporate AI into your organization's existing processes.

You can also integrate MindStudio easily into your own applications via API, allowing you to run headless AI Workflows within your own proprietary apps.
