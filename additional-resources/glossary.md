# Glossary

#### **AI Worker**

An AI-powered automation or workflow created within MindStudio. AI Workers are designed to perform specific tasks, ranging from data processing to content generation, and can be deployed in various applications.

#### **Automation Block**

A modular unit within a workflow that performs a specific function (e.g., generating text, calling a function, querying data). Blocks are the building components of workflows on the canvas.

#### **Canvas**

The visual interface where workflows are designed and structured. The canvas allows users to connect automation blocks and configure their interactions to build AI Workers.

#### **Data Source**

An external or internal repository of information (e.g., databases, APIs) that workflows can query to retrieve data or send results for storage.

#### **Drafts**

Unpublished versions of workflows or AI Workers within a workspace. Drafts allow users to iterate and test changes before making them live.

#### **Function**

A custom code block written in JavaScript or Python that adds specific functionality to a workflow. Functions enable developers to extend workflows with tailored logic and processing.

#### **Markdown**

A lightweight markup language used to format text. In MindStudio, Markdown is often used for prompts, documentation, or configuring UI elements within workflows.

#### **Prompt**

A set of instructions or input text sent to an underlying model to guide its behavior. Prompts are critical for shaping AI-generated outputs and are often dynamic, incorporating variables.

#### **Underlying Model**

The AI or machine learning model powering an AI Worker's functionality. Examples include GPT models for natural language processing or DALL-E for image generation.

#### **Usage**

A metric that tracks the consumption of resources (e.g., API calls, compute time) within a workspace. It provides insights into how AI Workers and workflows are utilized, helping monitor costs and efficiency.

#### **User Input**

Data or parameters provided by end-users or external systems that are used to guide the behavior of an AI Worker or workflow. User inputs can be configured in the workflow for flexibility.

#### **Variable**

A placeholder used within workflows to store and pass data between steps. Variables can represent inputs, intermediate values, or outputs, ensuring data flows smoothly through the workflow.

#### **Workspace**

A dedicated environment in MindStudio for organizing and managing AI Workers, workflows, team members, and billing settings. Workspaces allow teams to collaborate and operate independently within the platform.
