## **Key Features of an AI Agent**

**Task Automation**

AI Agents are designed to execute tasks automatically based on your configurations. Most of the tasks that are executed leverage AI models to complete the task.

**AI-Powered Actions**

AI Agents utilize AI models to perform actions such as text generation, summarization, image generation, data extraction, and analysis, and more.

**Customizable Workflows**

Each AI Agent is built using workflows that define its behavior. Workflows are a sequence of tasks that the Agent executes each time it runs.

**Dynamic and Flexible**

AI Agents leverage variables, triggers, and conditions to customize the Agent's output based on specific inputs or contexts.

**Integration-Ready**

AI Agents can be integrated with other platforms and tools via APIs or third-party services like Zapier.
