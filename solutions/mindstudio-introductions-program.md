# MindStudio Introductions Program

**TL;DR**

* Introduce us to your friends that work in companies / orgs of all types (over 20 employees)
* We will schedule a free 1 hour “Lunch and Learn” training session, where we will uplevel their team’s knowledge of applied AI, and teach them to build custom AI Agents for their business. No technical skills are required on their part. Anyone can build AI Agents with MindStudio.
* We will also give them free access to MindStudio’s Business Tier for a month, so they can build as many Agents as they need, and experience the impact of AI Agents in their own business.
* If they end up wanting to become a customer and switch to a paid plan, we will compensate you for making the introduction – 20% of what they spend for an entire year. See below for some back of napkin math (this could be in the thousands of dollars).

## Overview

Organizations of all kinds use MindStudio to transform their workflows, business processes, and operations.

* His Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (British tax authority) uses MindStudio to scale recruiting.
* ServiceNow leverages MindStudio Agents to help close multi-million dollar deals.
* Advance Local (large newspaper publisher) has almost 300 MindStudio AI Agents helping to automate news gathering, analysis, and production.
* Leading universities like Stanford, Harvard, and Brigham Young use MindStudio to prepare students for using AI in the workforce

Once organizations **experience** the power of MindStudio, they are sold! There are now over 200k AI Agents deployed across SMBs, mid-market, enterprise, and government.

## Aligned Incentives

Every leader (manager, director, vp, chief) inside of every organization is tasked with leveling up their team’s AI knowledge, and getting their team members using AI in their work

Most don’t know where to start. When you offer them a free Lunch & Learn + 1 month of access, you are making their job easier by helping them deliver exactly what is being asked of them.
