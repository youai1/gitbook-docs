# MindStudio For Developers

MindStudio is a platform that allows developers to build and deploy **serverless AI Functions** that can handle a wide variety of tasks‚Äîfrom recommending products to flagging fraudulent orders, all without writing traditional code.

With **MindStudio**, developers and organizations can build intelligent, serverless AI Functions today‚Äîfunctions that can do surprisingly powerful things with just a few inputs and a bit of creativity.

MindStudio is more than an AI tool‚Äîit's a full development environment designed to make it easy for anyone to build, deploy, monitor, and scale AI-driven capabilities across products and systems.

* Combine multiple AI models in one function
* Instantly test and iterate in a built-in
* View detailed traces of requests
* Integrate live data and API calls
