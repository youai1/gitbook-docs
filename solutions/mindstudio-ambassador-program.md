## About the MindStudio Referral Program

When people join MindStudio using your custom link, and convert to a paid plan, you get 20% of their spend for an entire year!!

What does that actually mean?

We have 3 paid plans.

1. **Pro: costs the user $15 / month.** You make $3 / month for each Pro user. If they stay for a year, you earned $36.
2. **Business: costs the user $100 / month.** You make $20 / month. If they stay for a year, you earned $240.&#x20;
   1. **Note...Business plan also supports "Add Ons"**, additional functionality that is available (Agent Embedding). When users upgrade their Business Plan with add ons, you make 20% of that as well -- so the commissions could be dramatically higher than $240.
3. **Enterprise -- Anywhere from $1k / month to tens of thousands of $ per month.** If you refer the user who then turns into an Enterprise plan, you make 20% -- this could be thousands of dollars per month for you.
