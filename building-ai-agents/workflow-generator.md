# Workflow Generator

The **Workflow Generator** feature in MindStudio is a powerful tool that simplifies the creation of AI Agents. By describing your desired outcome, the feature automatically generates a detailed workflow plan, complete with prompts, variables, automation steps, and custom functions.&#x20;

## How to use the Workflow Generator

### Step 1: Access the Workflow Generator

1. Open a new or existing project in MindStudio.
2. Navigate to the bottom bar and select the **Generate Workflow** button.

### Step 2: Describe your AI Agent

A modal will appear asking you to describe what you want your AI Agent to do. Click **Generate** to let MindStudio process your request.

Example:&#x20;

> Ask the user for their name and birthday, then write them a horoscope.

### Step 3: View the AI Generated Workflow Proposal

#### **Once the workflow is generated:**

**Left Panel**: Displays a detailed plan of the workflow, including the system prompt, steps, and variable definitions.

**Right Panel**: Translates the plan into executable automation steps, complete with code and configurations.

#### **Key components generated by AI:**

* **System Prompt**: Pre-configured text to guide the workflow.
* **Variables**: Input fields like `name` and `birthdate`.
* **Custom Functions**: Auto-generated JavaScript or Python functions, such as one to compute a zodiac sign from a birthdate.
* **Automation Steps**: A preview of the blocks added to the workflow.

### Step 4: Approve Proposal and Test

1. If the generated workflow looks good, click **Accept and Build**.
2. MindStudio will automatically construct the workflow on the canvas.

### Step 5: Debug and Refine

* Use the [**Debugger**](../test-and-evaluate/debugger.md) to analyze the execution of the workflow:
  * Review logs for actions, variable updates, and custom function outputs.
  * Identify and fix any issues or edge cases.
* Refine the workflow by adjusting blocks, variables, or custom function code.
* Use the preview mode to test the draft:
  * Input test data.
  * Observe the execution in real-time, including the generated outputs.

## **Important: Review Your AI Generated Builds**

While the **Generate Workflow** feature in MindStudio is a powerful tool for automating workflow creation, itâ€™s essential to review all generated outputs when accepting an auto-generated build. The feature uses AI to interpret your descriptions and generate workflows, but it is still prone to occasional errors or misconfigurations.

***

### **Potential Issues to Watch For**

#### **Incorrect or Missing Variable Connections**

Variables used in prompts, automation blocks, or custom functions may not always be wired correctly.

> **Example:** A variable like `birthdate` might be declared but not correctly referenced in a custom function or automation step.

**Custom Function Errors**

Auto-generated functions may contain logical gaps or mismatched input expectations.

> **Example:** A function might expect a variable in one format (e.g., a string) but receive it in another (e.g., an object).

#### **Incomplete Automation Steps**

Sometimes, blocks may not be fully configured, leaving placeholders or missing settings.

> **Example:** An API call block might not have the correct headers or endpoint set up.

#### **Unclear Edge Case Handling**

The workflow may not account for scenarios like invalid inputs, empty responses, or unexpected user behavior.

***

### **Best Practices**

#### **Thoroughly Review the Workflow Plan**

Before clicking **Accept and Build**, carefully examine the generated plan, especially variable assignments, function configurations, and block connections.

#### **Test Custom Functions**

Use the test interface in the function editor to validate inputs, outputs, and logic. Adjust the code as necessary.

#### **Run the Workflow in Preview Mode**

Test the workflow with various inputs to identify gaps or inconsistencies in execution.

#### **Use the Debugger**

Analyze runtime logs to ensure all variables and blocks function as intended. Pay close attention to variable updates and outputs.

#### **Iterate on the Build**

Treat the generated workflow as a scaffold. Refine and enhance it to meet your specific needs and address any issues.

## **Final Note**

The **Workflow Generator** is designed to save time and provide a strong starting point, but human oversight is crucial. Always validate the output, refine where necessary, and ensure your workflows are robust and error-free before deploying them in production.&#x20;
