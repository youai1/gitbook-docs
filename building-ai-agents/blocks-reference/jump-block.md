The **Jump Block** enables you to route the current workflow to a completely different workflow. This block is ideal for modularizing workflows or reusing common processes across multiple workflows.

## **Configurations**

### **Workflow**

* **Select the Workflow**: Use the dropdown menu to choose an existing workflow.
* **Create a New Workflow**: Click the **New...** button to create and configure a new workflow directly. Once created, it will automatically be available in the dropdown.
