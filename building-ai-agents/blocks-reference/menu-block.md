The **Menu Block** allows you to present users with a question or statement and multiple options to choose from. Based on the selection, the workflow will route to a corresponding block path. It is ideal for guiding user interactions, creating decision points, and defining different workflow paths.

## **Configurations**

### **Prompt**

Enter the question or statement to display to the user. Use clear and concise language to ensure the user understands the options presented.

**Example**: “What would you like to do next?”

### **Options**

Define the selectable options for the user and map each option to a specific route in the workflow.

* Add options using the **+** button.
* Each option can trigger a unique path or action in the workflow.

**Example Options**:

1. “View Account Details” → Route to the account information workflow.
2. “Contact Support” → Route to a support request form.
