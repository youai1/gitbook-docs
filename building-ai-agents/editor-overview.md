# Editor Overview

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/fBT6djVTmaA" %}

After creating a new AI Agent, you’ll land in the MindStudio Editor. The editor is made of two key areas: the **Explorer** and the **Navigator** (commonly referred to as the **Workspace Area**).

### **Explorer Tab**

On the left you’ll find the **Explorer Tab.** This is where you'll find all of the resources used to build your AI Agents.
